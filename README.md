### Hi! I'm Anshul ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my homepage! In November 2023, I graduated with my [honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree) undergraduate degree in [computer science](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/undergraduate/programs/specializations/computer-science.php) at [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca). The pinned repositories contain implementations of highlight software projects completed during my time at Queen's. Some of these projects include code specific to course assignments, and some of these courses may be offered in the Winter 2024 term: to maintain academic integrity for students currently enrolled in these courses, relevant implementations will be removed from my GitHub by February 15, 2024. 

For applications, I tend to submit a version of this [one-page curriculum vitae](https://apattoo-graduate-school-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/Anshul_Pattoo_CV_(One-Page).pdf) to ensure that the most essential accomplishments receive focus. However, if there is an interest in learning further about my experience, an ostentatiously longer, [two-page CV](https://apattoo-graduate-school-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/Anshul_Pattoo_CV_(Two-Page).pdf) can be accessed here.

Also available here is a document outlining [relevant courses](https://apattoo-graduate-school-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/Anshul_Pattoo_Grades_Sheet_(Relevant+Courses).pdf) studied at Queen's, including grades achieved and web-based sample syllabi for select courses (either from the offering of the term in question, or an alternate term), where available. Courses highlighted in blue indicate substantial, challenging work, having considerably influenced my intellectual development in computer science. 

Please note that, at the current time (Jan. to Feb. 2024), my GitHub profile is continually being updated, as I obtain and organize implementations produced in the past for effective presentation. However, the implementations presented as of current writing provide a comprehensive overview of my qualifications. Please also note that, for privacy, around mid to late March of this year (2024), my CVs and grades sheet will no longer be publicly available.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate! I am generally responsive to emails.
